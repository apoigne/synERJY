Requirements for using Atmel Processors:
----------------------------------------

In order to program an atmel-avr microcontroller you have
to install the cross compiler  "avr-gcc"

1. Download WinAVR from the following link:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr

2. Install WinAVR in your local directory, i.e, C:/WinAVR 
   or any other path you choose. The installer will 
   automatically set path in the environment variable
   of your system

3. Check in your system variable if the following paths
   for WinAVR are set:
	C:/WinAVR/bin
	C:/WinAVR/utils/bin
   If not, edit them manually in your system path.
